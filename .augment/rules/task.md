You're helping me build a multi-tenant POS web app using Next.js (App Router), Supabase, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

Please follow this task list step by step and stop after each one to:

1. Show the result visually (UI and/or code)
2. Explain how to test or view the result
3. Ask for confirmation before continuing to the next task

Hereâ€™s the full task list you must follow:

1. Install required dependencies: @supabase/supabase-js, shadcn/ui, lucide-react, zod, clsx - ok
2. Set up the Supabase database schema (users, stores, products, transactions, transaction_items) - ok
3. Add authentication via Supabase and connect it to the frontend - ok
4. On sign up, automatically create a new store and assign the user as an owner - ok
5. On login, redirect to /dashboard - ok
6. Add middleware.ts to protect all /dashboard/\* routes - ok
7. Set up a layout for /dashboard with sidebar and header using shadcn/ui - ok
8. Build the Products page with crud functionality - ok
9. Build a POS transaction page - ok
10. Add simple sales reports
11. Add staff management (invite/remove cashiers)
12. Ensure role-based access control for each page
13. Add logout, responsive design, and polish the UI

I've already set up my `.env.local` with Supabase credentials and initialized the project.

Now begin with Task 1. Stop after finishing and show me the result.
